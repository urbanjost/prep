NOTE:
  Assuming the aux/ directory is in your command path or txt2man(1) will

  If you want to write a free-format document as a routine that can be
  called by your program and optionally also write that text to a file
  possibly for further post-processing you can use the $BLOCK HELP
  directive and use $SYSTEM to do the processing.  

  So on GNU/Linux and Unix machines this would make the output 
  directories and write the help into the doc/ directory and call a
  postprocessor that converts the text to a man-page (see txt2man(1))
  and place the same help text into a self-contained subroutine that
  can be called by the program and the only thing you have to do is 
  change the free-format text block in your source file.

NAME
    conditional_compile(1f) - basic example for prep(1) pre-processor.

SYNOPSIS
    conditional_example [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
   This is a basic example program showing how documentation can be used
   to generate program help text

OPTIONS
   --help     display this help and exit
   --version  output version information and exit
$BLOCK

$! convert the help text from a flat text file to a roff file using txt2man(1)
