.SS   IMPORTANT
For compatibility with other utilities where \fBcpp\fP(1)\fB-like\fP syntax is required
if \fB-i\fP is not specified and the unnamed parameters are less than three the
unnamed parameters are assumed to be the input file and optional output
file instead of macro definitions if the first parameter matches an existing
filename.
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBprep\fP(1) is a Fortran source preprocessor.
.PP
A preprocessor performs operations on input files before they are passed to
a compiler, including conditional selection of lines based on directives
contained in the file. This makes it possible to use a single source file
even when different code is required for different programming environments.
.PP
The \fBprep\fP(1) preprocessor has additional features that support free-format
documentation in the same file as the source and the generation of generic
code using a simple templating technique. The basic directives \.\.\..
.IP \(bu 3
Conditionally output parts of the source file (controlled by expressions
on the directives $IF, $IFDEF, $IFNDEF, and $ENDIF. The expressions may
include variables defined on the command line or via the directives
$DEFINE, and $\fBUNDEFINE\fP).
.IP \(bu 3
Include other files (provided by directive $INCLUDE).
.IP \(bu 3
Define parcels of text that may be replayed multiple times with
expansion, allowing for basic templating (controlled by directives
$PARCEL/$ENDPARCEL and $POST). The mechanism supported is to replace
text of the form ${NAME} with user-supplied strings similar to the
POSIX shell (controlled by directives $SET, $UNSET and $IMPORT).
.IP \(bu 3
Filter blocks of text and convert them to comments, a CHARACTER array,
Fortran WRITE statements, \.\.\. (provided by the $BLOCK directive.)
.RS
.PP
The blocks of text may also be written to a file and executed, with
stdout captured and included in the \fBprep\fP(1) output file.
.PP
Blocked text may optionally be simultaneously written to a separate file,
typically for use as documentation.
.RE
.IP \(bu 3
Call system commands (using the $SYSTEM directive).
.IP \(bu 3
Generate multiple output files from a single input file (using $OUTPUT).
.IP \(bu 3
Record the parameters used and the date and time executed as Fortran
comments in the output (using $SHOW).
.IP \(bu 3
Stop the preprocessing (controlled by directive $STOP, $QUIT or $ERROR)
and produce messages on stderr (using $MESSAGE).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fIdefine_list\fP, \fB-D\fP \fIdefine_list\fP
An optional space-delimited list of expressions
used to define variables before file processing
commences. These can subsequently be used in
$IF/$ELSE/$ELSEIF and $DEFINE directives.
.TP
.B \fB-i\fP "\fIinput_file(s)\fP"
The default input file is stdin. Filenames are
space-delimited. In a list, @ represents stdin.
.PP
The suggested suffix for Fortran input files is ".ff" for code files unless
they contain $SYSTEM directives in which case ".FF" is preferred. $INCLUDE
files should use ".ffinc" and ".FFINC" if they include \fBprep\fP(1) directives.
This naming convention is not required.
.PP
Files may also end in supported suffixes such as ".md", as explained under
the \fB--type\fP option description.
.TP
.B \fB-o\fP \fIoutput_file\fP
The default output file is stdout.
.PP
\fB-I\fP "\fIinclude_directories\fP" The directories to search for files specified on
$INCLUDE directives. May be repeated.
.TP
.B \fB--system\fP
Allow system commands on $SYSTEM directives to be executed.
.TP
.B \fB--type\fP FILETYPE
This flag indicates to skip input lines until after a
specific start string is encountered and to stop once a
specific end string is found, left-justified on lines by
themselves.

                        auto
                        none

.fam T
.fi
The default type is "auto", in which case files will be
processed according to their file suffix.
.RS
.PP
This allows for easily extracting code from common document
formats. This is particularly useful with extended markdown
formats, allowing for code source to be easily documented
and for tests in documents to be able to be extracted and
tested. "auto" switches processing mode depending on input
file suffix, treating supported file suffixes
("md","html","tex") appropriately.
.RE
.TP
.B \fB--start\fP STRING
Same as --type except along with --stop allows for custom
strings to be specified.
.TP
.B \fB--stop\fP STRING
Same as --type except along with --start allows for custom
strings to be specified.
.TP
.B \fB--comment\fP
Try to style comments generated in $BLOCK COMMENT blocks
for other utilities such as doxygen. Default is to
prefix lines with '! '. Allowed keywords are
currently "default", "doxygen","none","ford".
THIS IS AN ALPHA FEATURE AND NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED.
.TP
.B \fB--prefix\fP ADE|letter
The directive prefix character. The default is "$".
If the value is numeric it is assumed to be an ASCII
Decimal Equivalent (Common values are 37=% 42=* 35=#
36=$ 64=@).
.TP
.B \fB--noenv\fP
The $IFDEF and $IFNDEF directives test for an internal
\fBprep\fP(1) variable and then an environment variable by
default. This option turns off testing for environment
variables.
.TP
.B \fB--keeptabs\fP
By default tab characters are expanded assuming a stop has
been set every eight columns; and trailing carriage-return
are removed. Use this flag to prevent this processing from
from occurring.
.TP
.B \fB--ident\fP
The output of the $IDENT directive is in the form of a
comment by default. If this flag is set the output is
of the form described in the $IDENT documentation
so executables and object code can contain the metadata
for use with the \fBwhat\fP(1) command. Note this generates an
unused variable which some compilers might optimize
away depending on what compilation options are used.
.TP
.B \fB-d\fP ignore|remove|blank
Enable special treatment for lines beginning
with "d" or "D". The letter will be left as-is
(the default); removed; or replaced with a blank
character. This non-standard syntax has been
used to support the optional compilation of
"debug" code by many Fortran compilers when
compiling fixed-format Fortran source.
.TP
.B \fB--width\fP \fIn\fP
Maximum line length of the output file. The default is 1024.
The parameter is typically used to trim fixed-format Fortran
code that contains comments or "ident" labels past column 72
when compiling fixed-format Fortran code.
.TP
.B \fB--verbose\fP
All commands on a $SYSTEM directive are echoed to stderr with a
"+" prefix. Text following the string "@(#)" is printed to stderr
similar to the Unix command \fBwhat\fP(1) but is otherwise treated as
other text input. Additional descriptive messages are produced.
.TP
.B \fB--version\fP
Display version and exit
.TP
.B \fB--help\fP
Display documentation and exit.
.SH INPUT FILE SYNTAX

The \fBprep\fP(1) preprocessor directives begin with "$" (by default) in column
one, and \fBprep\fP(1) will output no such lines. Other input is conditionally
written to the output \fBfile\fP(s) based on the case-insensitive command names.
.PP
An exclamation character FOLLOWED BY A SPACE on most directives
begins an in-line comment that is terminated by an end-of-line. The space
is required so comments are not confused with C-style logical operators such
as "!", which may NOT be followed by a space.
.SS VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS

INTEGER or LOGICAL expressions are used to conditionally select
output lines. An expression is composed of INTEGER and LOGICAL
constants, variable names, and operators. Operators are processed
as in Fortran and/or C expressions. The supported operators are \.\.\.

.SH DIRECTIVES

The directives fall into the following categories:
.SS VARIABLE DEFINITION FOR CONDITIONALS
Directives for defining variables \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      $DEFINE   variable_name[=expression] [;\.\.\.]          [! comment ]
      $UNDEFINE|$UNDEF variable_name [;\.\.\.]                [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
Details \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      $DEFINE variable_name [=expression]; \.\.\. [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
Defines a numeric or logical variable name and its value. The variable
names may subsequently be used in the expressions on the conditional output
selector directives $IF, $ELSEIF, $IFDEF, and $IFNDEF.
.PP
If the result of the expression is ".TRUE." or ".FALSE." then the variable
will be of type LOGICAL, otherwise the variable is of type INTEGER (and the
expression must be an INTEGER expression or null). If no value is supplied
the variable is given the INTEGER value "1".
.PP
Variables are defined from the point they are declared in a $DEFINE
directive or the command line until program termination unless explicitly
undefined with a $\fBUNDEFINE\fP directive.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $define A                        ! will have default value of "1"
    > $define B = 10 - 2 * 2**3 / 3    ! integer expressions
    > $define C=1+1; D=(-40)/(-10)
    > $define bigd= d  >=  a; bigb = ( (b >= c) && (b > 0) )  ! logical
    > $if ( A + B ) / C  ==  1
    >    (a+b)/c is one
    > $endif
.fam T
.fi
Note expressions are not case-sensitive.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $UNDEFINE variable_name[; \.\.\.]

.fam T
.fi
A symbol defined with $DEFINE can be removed with the $\fBUNDEFINE\fP directive.
Multiple names may be specified, preferably separated by semi-colons.
.PP
Basic globbing is supported, where "*" represents any string, and "?"
represents any single character.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       DEFINED(variable_name[,\.\.\.])

.fam T
.fi
A special function called \fBDEFINED\fP() may appear only in a $IF or $ELSEIF.
If "variable_name" has been defined at that point in the source code,
then the function value is ".TRUE.", otherwise it is ".FALSE.". A name is
defined only if it has appeared in the source previously in a $DEFINE
directive or been declared on the command line.
The names used in compiler directives are district from names in the
Fortran source, which means that "a" in a $DEFINE and "a" in a Fortran
source statement are totally unrelated.
The \fBDEFINED\fP() variable is NOT valid in a $DEFINE directive.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    >        Program test
    > $IF .NOT. DEFINED (inc)
    >        INCLUDE "comm.inc"
    > $ELSE
    >        INCLUDE "comm2.inc"
    > $ENDIF
    >        END

.fam T
.fi
The file, "comm.inc" will be included in the source if the variable
"inc", has not been previously defined, while INCLUDE "comm2.inc" will
be included in the source if "inc" has been defined.
.PP
Predefined variables are

.fi
Details \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $IF/$ELSEIF/$ELSE/$ENDIF directives \.\.\.

.fam T
.fi
Each of these control lines delineates a block of source lines. If the
expression following the $IF is ".TRUE.", then the following lines of
source following are output. If it is ".FALSE.", and an $ELSEIF
follows, the expression is evaluated and treated the same as the $IF. If
the $IF and all $ELSEIF expressions are ".FALSE.", then the lines of
source following the optional $ELSE are output. A matching $ENDIF ends the
conditional block.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $IFDEF/$IFNDEF directives \.\.\.

.fam T
.fi
$IFDEF and $IFNDEF are special forms of the $IF directive that simply test
if a variable name is defined or not.
.PP
The expressions may optionally be enclosed in parenthesis and followed by
the keyword "THEN", ie. they may use Fortran syntax. For example, the
previous example may also be written as:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     > $IF(OS .EQ. LINUX)THEN
     >    write(*,*)"System type is Linux"
     > $ELSEIF(OS .EQ. WINDOWS)THEN
     >    write(*,*)"System type is MSWindows"
     > $ELSE
     >    write(*,*)"System type is unknown"
     > $ENDIF

.fam T
.fi
Essentially, these are equivalent:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $IFDEF varname  ==> $IF DEFINED(varname)
       $IFNDEF varname ==> $IF .NOT. DEFINED(varname)

.fam T
.fi
except that environment variables are tested as well by $IFDEF and $IFNDEF
if the \fB--noenv\fP option is not specified, but never by the function \fBDEFINED\fP(),
allowing for environment variables to be selectively used or ignored.
The \fB--noenv\fP switch is therefore only needed for compatibility with \fBfpp\fP(1).
For the purposes of \fBprep\fP(1) an environment variable is defined if it is
returned by the system and has a non-blank value.
.SS MACRO STRING EXPANSION AND TEXT REPLAY

.nf
.fam C
       $PARCEL blockname / $ENDPARCEL                       [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
The block of lines between a "$PARCEL name" and "$ENDPARCEL" directive are
written to a scratch file WITHOUT expanding directives. the scratch file can
then be read in with the $POST directive much like a named file can be with
$INCLUDE except the file is automatically deleted at program termination.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $POST     blockname(s)                               [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
Read in a scratch file created by the $PARCEL directive. Combined with
$SET and $IMPORT directives this allows you to replay a section of input
and replace strings as a simple templating technique, or to repeat lines
like copyright information or definitions of (obsolescent) Fortran COMMON
blocks, but contained in source files without the need for separate
INCLUDE files or error-prone repetition of the declarations.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $SET varname  string

.fam T
.fi
If a $SET or $IMPORT directive defines a name \fBprep\fP(1) enters expansion mode.
In this mode anywhere the string "${NAME}" is encountered in subsequent
output it is replaced by "string".
.IP \(bu 3
values are case-sensitive but variable names are not.
.IP \(bu 3
expansion of a line may cause it to be longer than allowed by some
compilers. Automatic breaking into continuation lines does not occur.
.IP \(bu 3
comments are not supported on a $SET directive because everything past the
variable name becomes part of the value.
.IP \(bu 3
The pre-defined values $FILE, $LINE, $DATE, and $TIME ( for input file,
line in input file, date and time ) are NOT ACTIVE until at least one
one $SET or $IMPORT directive is processed. That is, unless a variable
is defined no ${NAME} expansion occurs.
.IP \(bu 3
The time and date refers to the time of processing, not the time of
compilation or loading.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $set author  William Shakespeare
    > write(*,*)'By ${AUTHOR}'
    > write(*,*)'File ${FILE}'
    > write(*,*)'Line ${LINE}'
    > write(*,*)'Date ${DATE}'
    > write(*,*)'Time ${TIME}'
.fam T
.fi
\.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $UNSET varname(s)

.fam T
.fi
Unset variables set with the $SET directive.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $IMPORT   envname[;\.\.\.]                              [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
The values of environment variables may be imported just like their names
and values were used on a $SET directive. The names of the variables are
case-sensitive in regards to obtaining the values, but the names become
case-insensitive in \fBprep\fP(). That is, "import home" gets the lowercase
environment variable "home" and then sets the associated value for the
variable "HOME" to the value.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $import HOME USER
    > write(*,*)'HOME ${HOME}'

       $OUTPUT   filename  [--append]                          [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
Specifies the output file to write to. This overrides the initial output file
specified with command line options. If no output filename is given
\fBprep\fP(1) reverts back to the initial output file. "@" is a synonym for stdout.
.PP
Files are open at the first line by default. Use the \fB--append\fP switch to
append to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting it.
.PP
.nf
.fam C

.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $INCLUDE filename

.fam T
.fi
Read in the specified input file. Fifty (50) nesting levels are allowed.
Following the tradition of \fBcpp\fP(1) if "<filename>" is specified the file is
only searched for relative to the search directories, otherwise it is
searched for as specified first. Double-quotes in the filename are treated
as in Fortran list-directed input.

      WRITE:     write text as Fortran WRITE(3f) statements
                 The Fortran generated is free-format. It is assumed the
                 output will not generate lines over 132 columns.
      VARIABLE:  write as a text variable. The name may be defined using
                 the --varname switch. Default name is "textblock".

      SET:       All the lines in the block are treated as options to $SET
      DEFINE:    All the lines in the block are treated as options to $DEFINE
      SYSTEM:    The lines are gathered into a file and executed by the shell
                 with the stdout being written to a scratch file and then read
      END:       End block of specially processed text

If the "\fB--file\fP NAME" option is present the text is written to the
specified file unfiltered except for string expansion. This allows
documentation to easily be maintained in the source file. It can be
tex, html, markdown or any plain text. The filename will be prefixed
with $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/ . If the environment variable
$PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is not set the option is ignored.
.PP
The \fB--file\fP output can subsequently easily be processed by other utilities
such as \fBmarkdown\fP(1) or \fBtxt2man\fP(1) to produce \fBman\fP(1) pages and HTML documents.
$SYSTEM commands may follow the $BLOCK block text to optionally post-process
the doc files.
.PP
$ENDBLOCK ends the block.
.SS IDENTIFIERS
Directives for producing metadata \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $IDENT|$@(#) metadata [--language fortran|c|shell]      [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
$IDENT is a special-purpose directive useful to users of SCCS-metadata.
The string generated can be used by the \fBwhat\fP(1) command,
.PP
When the command line option "\fB--ident\fP [LANGUAGE]" is specified this directive
writes a line using SCCS-metadata format of one of the following forms:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     language:
     fortran   character(len=*),parameter::ident="@(#)metadata"
     c         #ident "@(#)metadata"
     shell     #@(#) metadata

.fam T
.fi
The default language is "fortran".
.PP
Depending on your compiler and the optimization level used when compiling,
the output string may not remain in the object files and executables created.
.PP
If the \fB-ident\fP switch is not specified, a Fortran comment line is generated
of the form
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       ! ident_NNN="@(#)this is metadata"

.fam T
.fi
"$@(#)" is an alias for "$IDENT" so the source file itself will contain
SCCS-metadata so the metadata can be displayed with \fBwhat\fP(1) even for the
unprocessed files.
.PP
Do not use the characters double-quote, greater-than, backslash (ie. ">\\)
in the metadata to remain compatible with SCCS metadata syntax.
Do not use strings starting with " -" either.
.SS INFORMATION
Informative directives for writing messages to stderr or inserting
state information into the output file \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $SHOW [variable_name[;\.\.\.]]                          [! comment ]
       $MESSAGE  message_to_stderr

.fam T
.fi
Details \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $MESSAGE  message_to_stderr

.fam T
.fi
Write message to stderr.
Note that messages for $MESSAGE do not treat "! " as starting a comment
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $SHOW [variable_name[;\.\.\.]]                          [! comment ]

.fam T
.fi
Shows current state of \fBprep\fP(1); including variable names and values and
the name of the current input files. All output is preceded by an
exclamation character.
.PP
If a list of defined variable names is present only those variables and
their values are shown.
.PP
Basic globbing is supported, where "*" represents any string, and "?"
represents any single character.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > prep A=10 B C D -o paper
    > $define z=22
    > $show B Z
    > $show
    > $show H*;*H;*H*! show beginning with "H", ending with "H", containing "H"

.SS SYSTEM COMMANDS
Directives that execute system commands \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       $SYSTEM system_command

.fam T
.fi
If system command processing is enabled using the \fB--system\fP switch system
commands can be executed for such tasks as creating files to be read or to
further process documents created by $BLOCK. $SYSTEM directives are errors
by default; as you clearly need to ensure the input file is trusted before
before allowing commands to be executed. Commands that are system-specific
may need to be executed conditionally as well.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $! build variable definitions using GNU/Linux commands
    > $SYSTEM echo system=`hostname` > compiled.h
    > $SYSTEM echo compile_time="`date`" >> compiled.h
    > $INCLUDE compiled.h

    > $if systemon      ! if --system switch is present on command line
    > $!  obtain up-to-date copy of source file from HTTP server:
    > $   SYSTEM wget http://repository.net/src/func.F90 -O - >_tmp.f90
    > $   INCLUDE _tmp.f90
    > $   SYSTEM  rm _tmp.f90
    > $endif

.fam T
.fi
System commands may also appear in a $BLOCK section. Combining several
features this uses the Linux \fBgetconf\fP(1) command to write some lines
into a scratch file that are then read back in to define variables describing
the current platform.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $IF OS == LINUX
    > $
    > $block system ! use getconf(1) command to get system values
    > (
    > echo LEVEL_2_CACHE_SIZE $(getconf LEVEL2_CACHE_SIZE)
    > echo LEVEL_3_CACHE_SIZE $(getconf LEVEL3_CACHE_SIZE)
    > ) >_getconf.inc
    > $endblock
    > $block set                 ! read in output of getconf(1)
    > $include _getconf.inc
    > $endblock
    > $system rm -f _getconf.inc ! cleanup
    > $
    > $ELSE
    > $
    > $error " ERROR: Not Linux. did not obtain system values"
    > $
    > $ENDIF
    > $! create code using values for this platform
    >    integer, parameter :: L2_CACHE_SZ=${LEVEL2_CACHE_SIZE}
    >    integer, parameter :: L3_CACHE_SZ=${LEVEL3_CACHE_SIZE}

.fam T
.fi
.SS PROGRAM TERMINATION
Directives for stopping file processing (note there is no comment field):
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      $STOP     [stop_value ["message"]]
      $QUIT     ["message"]
      $ERROR    ["message"]

.fam T
.fi
Details \.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      $STOP     [stop_value ["message"]]

.fam T
.fi
Stops the \fBprep\fP(1) program. The integer value will be returned as an exit
status value by the system where supported.
.IP \(bu 3
A value of "0" causes normal program termination.
.IP \(bu 3
The default value is "1".
.IP \(bu 3
comments are not supported on these directives; the entire line following
the directive command becomes part of the message.
.IP \(bu 3
If a message is supplied it is displayed to stderr.
If the value is not zero ("0") and no message is supplied the "$SHOW"
directive is called before stopping.
.IP \(bu 3
"$QUIT" is an alias for "$STOP 0".
.IP \(bu 3
"$ERROR" is a synonym for "$STOP 1"
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     >$IFNDEF TYPE
     >$STOP 10 "ERROR: ""TYPE"" not defined"
     >$ENDIF

.fam T
.fi
.SH LIMITATIONS

$IF constructs can be nested up to 20 levels deep. Note that using
more than two levels typically makes input files less readable.
.PP
$ENDBLOCK is required after a $BLOCK or \fB--file\fP FILENAME is not written.
.PP
Nesting of $BLOCK sections not allowed.
$INCLUDE may be nested fifty (50) levels.
.PP
Input files
.IP \(bu 3
lines are limited to a maximum of 1024 columns. Text past the limit is
ignored.
.IP \(bu 3
files cannot be concurrently opened multiple times
.IP \(bu 3
a maximum of 50 files can be nested by $INCLUDE
.IP \(bu 3
filenames cannot contain spaces on the command line.
.PP
Variable names
.IP \(bu 3
are limited to 63 characters.
.IP \(bu 3
must start with a letter (A-Z) or \fBunderscore\fP(_).
.IP \(bu 3
are composed of the letters A-Z, digits 0-9 and _ and $.
.IP \(bu 3
2048 variable names may be defined at a time.
.SH EXAMPLES

Define variables on command line:
.PP
Typically, variables are defined on the command line when \fBprep\fP(1) is
invoked but can be grouped together into small files that are included
with a $INCLUDE or as input files.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > prep HP size=64 -i hp_directives.dirs test.F90 -o test_out.f90

.fam T
.fi
defines variables HP and SIZE as if the expressions had been on a
$DEFINE and reads file "hp_directives.dirs" and then test.F90.
Output is directed to test_out.f90
.PP
Basic conditionals:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $! set variable "a" if not specified on the prep(1) command.
   > $IF .NOT.DEFINED(A)
   > $   DEFINE a=1  ! so only define the first version of SUB(3f) below
   > $ENDIF
   >    program conditional_compile
   >       call sub()
   >    end program conditional_compile
   > $! select a version of SUB depending on the value of variable "a"
   > $IF a .EQ. 1
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the first SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSEIF a  ==  2
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the second SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSE
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the third SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ENDIF

.fam T
.fi
Common use of $BLOCK
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $!
   > $BLOCK NULL --file manual.tex
   > This is a block of text that will be ignored except it is optionally
   > written to a $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/ file when $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set.
   > $ENDBLOCK
   >

.fam T
.fi
This is a block of text that will be converted to comments and optionally
appended to a $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/ file when $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $BLOCK COMMENT--file conditional_compile.man

.SH NOTE
Not documented elsewhere, note that there is a developer flag (\fB--debug\fP) that
can be useful when learning \fBprep\fP(1) usage (but it should not be used in
production). Among other things it deactivates the termination of the program
upon detection of an error. This mode thus allows for simple interactive use.
In addition, when in this mode entering "$HELP" produces a cribsheet, which
may also be displayed by "\fBprep\fP \fB--crib\fP".
