**2022-10-17**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :orange_circle: DIFF:
  +  If less than three macro definitions are specified and the first one is
     an existing filename and the -i option is not specified a cpp(1)-like
     syntax
```text
          cpp -D A -D B -D C .... infile [outfile]
```
     is used, instead of
```text
          cpp A B C .... -i infile [ -o outfile]
```
     because so many products except that because cpp(1) is so common.

### :orange_circle: DIFF:
  + The command parser was switched from M_kracken95 to M_CLI2.
    This means multiple values need quoted, so instead of 
    "-I dir1 dir2 dir3"  "-I 'dir1 dir2 dir3'" or "-I dir1 -I dir2
    -I dir3" is required for the -I and -D options, but also means
    multiple -I and -D switches will accumulate instead of only the
    right-most value being used.

    and \> suffix.

**2022-03-26**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :red_circle: FIX:
  + Negative values were unneccesarily not allowed in expressions except
    as a simple value.

### :orange_circle: DIFF:
  + A comment is explicitly an exclamation _followed by a space_
    to allow C-style operators in expressions such as !,!=, ...
    which must _not_ be followed by a space.
  + A $DEFINE of a defined value is a warning instead of an error

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + $SHOW can take a list of variable names and only print those
---
**2022-03-13**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  +  Added --type, --start, and --stop options primarily for allowing for
     extracting Fortran from extended markdown files.
---
**2021-10-19**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + Added algebraic operators (==,>=,<=,/=,>,<) to logical expressions
    in lieue of just dot operators (.eq.,.ge.,.le.,.ne.,.gt.,.lt.).
---
**2021-06-21**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + Added $BLOCK SHELL option using a simpler system-dependent approach
    with scratch files rather than with calls to popen(3c) in order to be
    more portable. The documentation is commented out at this time. This
    is an experimental feature undergoing evaluation and should not be
    depended on at this time as a standard feature. It is clearly highly
    system dependent and should be used with restraint.

**2021-06-16**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + Added $IMPORT so environment variables can be used as if they had been
    used to declare $SET names and values.                                

### :orange_circle: DIFF:
  + deprecated the $PRINTENV directive, as it is superceded by $IMPORT in
    a much more consistent way.
---
**2021-06-13**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + Try to guess value for predefined variable OS, and if a $SET directive
    has been entered create string values for "here document" expansion so
    that ${__FILE__}, ${__LINE__}, ${__DATE__}, ${__TIME__} strings will
    be predefined.
---
**2021-06-12**  John S. Urban <https://github.com/urbanjost>

### :green_circle: ADD:

  + Added $PARCEL, $POST, and $SET which allows for basic templating
    as a prototype for allowing expansion using POSIX shell syntax
    like a "here document".
