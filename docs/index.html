<h3>There are tons of pre-processors for Fortran. What are the pros and cons of prep(1) over others?</h3>
<h4>Sustainable</h4>
<p>prep(1) is written in Fortran, making it very easily maintained or modified in a Fortran programming environment. The file standalone/prep.f90 is a single Fortran file that intentionally avoids platform-specific code.</p>
<h4>Basic Templating</h4>
<p>prep(1) allows for templating via variable expansion using a POSIX-shell syntax which many are familiar with</p>
<h4>Fortran-like syntax</h4>
<p>Conditional expressions may be written very close to Fortran syntax, allowing for a low learning curve for Fortran programmers.</p>
<h4>Text-based documentation can easily be maintained in the source file</h4>
<p>It allows for plain text blocks to be written to a file, allowing markdown, HTML, and Latex to be easily incorporated straight in the code file, including an option to literally keep code in a Markdown file with the code delimited between the lines "```fortran" and "```".</p>
<p>The plain text blocks can additionally be filtered to become a CHARACTER array definition, WRITE() statements or comments.</p>
<p>It is a lot easier to maintain a large amount of text as simple lines than to maintain them as properly formatted variable definitions, for example.</p>
<p>A command-line flag (preliminary) allows the same text block to be formatted for use with Ford or Doxygen or as as-is comments. Support of in-line documentation is not a common Fortran-compatible preprocessor feature.</p>
<h4>No collisions with cpp(1)</h4>
<p>prep(1) intentionally does not use a pound prefix by default so that files (especially C) that already contain cpp(1) directives can be mixed in without collisions.</p>
<h4>Easy access to environment variables</h4>
<p>prep(1) also allows environment variables to be imported, and by default $IFNDEF|$IFDEF will test for environment variables as well as variables declared with $DEFINE. This allows for easier communication with the programming environment than fpp(1) or cpp(1) which require that kind of information to be passed in on the command line.</p>
<h3>On the con side ...</h3>
<p>prep(1) allows reuse of blocks but not true looping or a “for” statement.</p>
<p>cpp(1) and fpp(1) are often tightly coupled with the compiler, allowing for compiler-specific pre-defined variables. Supporting importing of environment variables addresses this to some extent.</p>
<p>Currently, prep(1) does not insert "# NNN “filename” lines for the debugger, but line counts and input files are tracked so that would be trivial to add.</p>
<p>There is not a warning about line length being exceeded nor support for automatic continuation lines. Again, easy to add but there should at least be a warning, as the changes to Fortran to eliminate the 132 column default line length limit will not be available on all compilers for a while although a lot of compilers already allow that.</p>
